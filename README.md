## Proposed Solution
**Idea Title:** Digital Farm Management Portal  

We developed a **web + mobile portal** for digital farm management to track antimicrobial usage and predict residue levels in livestock products.

**Key Features:**  
- **Drug Usage Log:** Record medicine type, dosage, withdrawal period.  
- **AI Drug Recommendation:** Suggest correct dosage and withdrawal period.  
- **Residue Monitoring:** Predict/track residue levels against MRL standards.  
- **Alerts & Notifications:** Notify when thresholds are crossed.  
- **Dashboards & Reports:** Analyze data per animal, farm, or region.  
- **Regulatory Compliance:** Generate reports for authorities.  

**Innovation:** Residue Prediction Engine using ML models and withdrawal period databases, enabling proactive prediction of residue levels before products reach the market.

---

## Technical Approach
- **Input:** Farmers/vets enter AMU data; lab results uploaded.  
- **Processing:** Backend validates dosage, predicts residue using rules/ML.  
- **Output:** Dashboards, alerts, compliance reports.  

**Technology Stack:**  
- **Frontend:** React.js (for mobile)  
- **Backend:** Node.js REST API  
- **Database:** PostgreSQL  
- **Analytics:** ML models for MRL prediction, visualization with PowerBI  
- **Cloud Hosting:** AWS (with offline support for low-connectivity areas)  
- **Security:** Role-based access, encrypted data storage  

---

## Impact & Benefits
- **Farmers:** Easy tracking of medicine usage, better herd health, reduced rejection of produce  
- **Consumers:** Safer food products, reduced antibiotic residues  
- **Government & Regulators:** Transparent monitoring, reliable data  
- **Society:** Contributes to fight against antimicrobial resistance (AMR)  
- **Economic Impact:** Higher quality exports, less loss due to rejected consignments  
- **Scalability:** Extendable nationwide, integrable with national livestock databases
